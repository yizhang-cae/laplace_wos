* Background
This =Stan= demo is a translation of one of my previosu R
projects, implementing the Walk-on-sphere(WOS) method to solve
the Laplace equation on a rectangle. This is the so-called
probabilistic mesh-free method for PDE solution. Essentially
the probabilistic interpretations of Laplace equation says
the solution is the mean of exit-points' function values of
Brownian motion. Instead of sampling the path of the
Brownian motion, we only need to sample the exit-points of
the Brownian motion that beginning at the location where we
wish to find PDE solution. This is a simplified version of
*Feyman-Kac formula*, which connects parabolic PDE with
Brownian motion. Since there is no inference, we run
=Stan= with =num_samples=1= and =algorithm=fixed_param=.


Specifically, we solve 

\begin{align*}
        \nabla^2 u(x ,y) = 0, & \quad \forall (x, y)\in \Omega= [0, 1] \times [0, 1],\\
        u = 0        ,& \quad \forall x=0,\\
        u = 0        ,& \quad \forall x=1,\\
        u = 0        ,& \quad \forall y=0,\\
        u = 75x      ,& \quad \forall y=1, x\in [0, 2/3],\\
        u = 150(1-x) ,& \quad \forall y=1, x\in [2/3, 1],
\end{align*}
